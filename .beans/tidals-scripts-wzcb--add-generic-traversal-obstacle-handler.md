Add a GenericTraversalHandler that matches objects with common traversal actions (Enter, Climb, Cross, Squeeze-through, Jump, Crawl-through, etc.) so the walker can handle cave entrances, agility shortcuts, and other non-standard obstacles without bespoke handlers for each one. Research MCP data to understand the landscape of traversal objects.
