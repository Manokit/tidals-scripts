# Milestone v1.0: TidalsGemMiner MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-16
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Build a gem mining script for Shilo Village with optional gem cutting. Start with project scaffolding and config UI, add the mining loop with failsafes, implement gem cutting and banking logic, then finish with stats overlay and dashboard reporting.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Script scaffolds with config UI ready
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: MINE-03, CUT-01, CUT-02, CODE-01
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding with task architecture and ScriptUI config

**Success Criteria:**
1. Script compiles and runs without errors
2. User can select mining location (upper/underground) in UI
3. User can toggle gem cutting option in UI
4. Chisel validation warns if cutting enabled without chisel

### Phase 2: Mining

**Goal**: Script mines gem rocks at either location with failsafes
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: MINE-01, MINE-02, MINE-04, MINE-05, MINE-06
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Core mining loop with rock detection and failsafes

**Success Criteria:**
1. Script mines gem rocks at upper (surface) location
2. Script mines gem rocks at underground location
3. Script walks to mine area if player is outside zone
4. Script waits and retries when rocks are depleted
5. Script stops with error if stuck for extended period

### Phase 3: Gem Processing

**Goal**: Gems are cut and banked correctly
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: CUT-03, CUT-04, CUT-05, BANK-01, BANK-02, BANK-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Gem cutting and banking tasks

**Success Criteria:**
1. Script cuts all gems player can cut when inventory full
2. Script drops crushed gems after cutting
3. Script deposits cut gems when cutting enabled
4. Script deposits raw gems when cutting disabled

### Phase 4: Stats & Polish

**Goal**: Paint overlay and dashboard reporting functional
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: STAT-01, STAT-02, STAT-03, STAT-04, STAT-05, STAT-06
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: XP tracking, paint overlay enhancement, and dashboard reporting

**Success Criteria:**
1. Paint displays Mining XP/hr, Crafting XP/hr, gems mined, gems cut
2. Logo displays in paint overlay
3. Stats report to dashboard every 10 minutes

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Used record type for MiningLocation (cleaner API, immutability)
- Upper mine hops worlds, underground waits (different rock availability)
- 5-minute stuck timeout (catches real stuck states)
- Cut highest-level gem first (XP efficiency)
- Task order: Setup -> Cut -> Bank -> Mine (proper state transitions)
- XPTracker API: getXpGained() not getXPGained() (actual API discovery)
- Combined XP for dashboard total (miningXp + craftingXp)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed .gitignore blocking subproject build.gradle files
- Corrected XPTracker API method names (getXpGained vs getXPGained)
- Corrected skill level detection API (XPTracker not SkillManager)
- Corrected item interaction API patterns

**Issues Deferred:**
None - all issues resolved during implementation.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None - all phases completed cleanly with no deferred items.
