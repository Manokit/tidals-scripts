# Requirements: TidalsGemMiner

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| World hopping | Mine rarely crowded enough to warrant it |
| Dragonstone special handling | Too rare, treated like other gems |
| Banking uncut gems when cutting enabled | Defeats the purpose of on-site cutting |
| Multiple chisel support | Single chisel sufficient, doesn't break |
